I’m currently a PhD candidate at the University of Vermont. I’m interested in how ecological processes differ across spatial, temporal, and hierarchical scales. Currently, my work focuses on small mammal community assembly, host-parasite interactions, and coffee rust transmission across landscapes.

## Research  

I use quantitative methods to examine how ecological processes vary across spatial, temporal, and organizational scales; especially in the context of community ecology and disease ecology. 

Over the course of my graduate studies I've also developed an interest in alternatives to p-value significance testing, and how these alternatives can be used to more effectively describe ecological systems. My past and current research primarily uses Bayesian hierarchical models, but I hope to expand to other quantitative techniques in the future. 

#### Host/ectoparasite interactions

Ectoparasites vary considerably in feeding mode and life history. This variation in turn affects how ectoparasites respond to processes operating on different scales. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques, I am investigating how an ectoparasite's life history, specifically the portion of the life cycle spent on-host, affects whether the host individual or the external environment play a bigger role in ectoparasite occupancy. 

#### Disease transmission at the landscape scale

Landscape structure influences the spread of plant pathogens, primarily by affecting pathogen dispersal. Coffee leaf rust (*Hemileia vastatrix*), a fungal disease that causes heavy economic losses in the coffee industry, is likely to be affected by landscape structure via dispersal of its wind-borne spores. My collaborators Natalia Aristizabal, Erika Bueno, Easton White, and I are using simulated landscapes to model the effects of landscape structure on coffee rust transmission.
