I’m currently a PhD candidate at the University of Vermont. I’m interested in how ecological processes differ across spatial, temporal, and hierarchical scales. Currently, my work focuses on small mammal community assembly, host-parasite interactions, and coffee rust transmission across landscapes.

## Research  

I use quantitative methods to examine how ecological processes vary across spatial, temporal, and organizational scales; especially in the context of community ecology and disease ecology. 

Over the course of my graduate studies I've also developed an interest in alternatives to p-value significance testing, and how these alternatives can be used to more effectively describe ecological systems. My past and current research primarily uses Bayesian hierarchical models, but I hope to expand to other quantitative techniques in the future. 

#### Host/ectoparasite interactions

Ectoparasites vary considerably in feeding mode and life history. This variation in turn affects how ectoparasites respond to processes operating on different scales. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques, I am investigating how an ectoparasite's life history, specifically the portion of the life cycle spent on-host, affects whether the host individual or the external environment play a bigger role in ectoparasite occupancy. 

#### Environmental effects on disease transmission and prevention

Landscape structure influences the spread of plant pathogens, primarily by affecting pathogen dispersal. Coffee leaf rust (*Hemileia vastatrix*), a fungal disease that causes heavy economic losses in the coffee industry, is likely to be affected by landscape structure via dispersal of its wind-borne spores. My collaborators Natalia Aristizabal, Erika Bueno, Easton White, and I are using simulated landscapes to model the effects of landscape structure on coffee rust transmission.

Urbanization can affect the transmission and management of zoonotic diseases via changes in host ecology or management strategies. This is particularly true for the raccoon variant of the rabies virus, for which urbanization results in increased population densities of the raccoon hosts and presents challenges for deployment of the oral rabies vaccine (ORV). With my collaborators Amy Davis, Kathy Nelson, Rich Chipman, and Amy Gilbert at USDA APHIS, I used a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly estimate raccoon abundance and rabies seroprevalence in the urban landscape of Burlington, Vermont.
